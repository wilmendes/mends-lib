# Mends Lib

This is my personal library of components and functions that I use in my projects. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to develop it.

## Installation

To install the library, run the following command:

`npm install mends-lib`

Add the followin to you `tailwind.config.js` file, for tailwind to load the styles:

```javascript
{
  content: ["./node_modules/mends-lib/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
}
```
